# Quantum Computing for Finance and Economics

This repository is dedicated to exploring the intersection of quantum computing, finance, and economics. Inspired by David Orrell’s insights into complexity, uncertainty, and the nature of financial systems, this project aims to experiment with quantum algorithms and models that could transform how we understand and model economic and financial phenomena.

**Key Goals:**
- Implement and test quantum algorithms relevant to financial modeling (e.g., portfolio optimization, option pricing, risk analysis).
- Explore quantum-inspired approaches to economic complexity and prediction.
- Compare classical and quantum approaches using real or simulated financial data.
- Document findings and share insights on the potential and limitations of quantum computing in finance.

**Tools & Technologies:**
- Python (Qiskit, PennyLane, Cirq)
- Jupyter notebooks for prototyping and analysis
- References and inspirations from David Orrell’s work on quantum economics
